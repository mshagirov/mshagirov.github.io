Pour yourself a fresh brew of Ruby, gem in some jekyll with bundler, create and
edit your markdown text, ask jekyll for a `new` project folder and serve it... tada!
Your (static) site is ready 🍽️

Initialise your project following ancient git ritual, and push it to Github.
Boom 🤯 , for better or worse you've got yourself a public website.

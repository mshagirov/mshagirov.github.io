Hello! Iâ€™m Murat, and welcome to my personal corner of the web.

My interests include but not limited to programming (Python, Go, C, ...),
configuring my neovim, anything to do with Linux. I did my PhD in Mechanobiology,
developing models for inferring biological tissue forces from microscopy movies.

In my free time, I like long walks and learning about programming and web
development.

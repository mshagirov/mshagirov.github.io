Hello! Iâ€™m Murat, and welcome to my personal corner of the web.

My interests include but not limited to programming (Python, Go, C, ...),
configuring my neovim, anything to do with Linux. I did my PhD in Mechanobiology,
developing models for inferring biological tissue forces from microscopy movies.

After completing my PhD, I took up a research fellow position at Mechanobiology
Institute, Singapore (MBI) at the institute's Microscopy Core. There, I worked
as an image analyst for a little more than a year.

Currently, I am part of MBI's IT Core managing our HPC and Kubernetes clusters
to support MBI's AI and HPC operations. In addition to my duties as a system
administrator, I work on my personal research projects developing deep learning
models for image-based force inference, organising tutorials and workshops on
Linux and Python, and collaborating with other researchers on similar topics
(AI4x, image analysis,...).

In my free time, I like long walks and learning about programming and web
development, mainly using Python and Go, and planning to start using Ruby, and
maybe Elixir (because functional programming, right!?).
